# Information about my website:
My website is a Portfolio of mine.
The website contains four pages:
1. Home page.
2. About page.
3. Skills page.
4. Projects page.

# challenges faced:
* A significant challenge I faced was mistakes and changes that affected other parts of the code. When I wrote some of the code and ran it, I found that the changes I made in one place also affected other parts of the site.
* Choosing a design: I had a hard time deciding on a specific design for the site since there are so many design options. I tried to think of the main purpose of the site and build the design around it.
* Determining colors: Many times I hesitated and consulted with people to choose the right colors to suit my website. 

# New css properties learned during development:
* During the project I acquired skill in using media queries. These queries were very necessary in order to carry out the project and adapt the code to all screen sizes.
* I discovered various animations that exist and how they enhance the website.
* I learned that to maintain order in a large project, it's beneficial to use separate CSS for each page.
